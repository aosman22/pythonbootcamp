Strings are not **mutable** meaning you can not use indexing to change individual elements of a string. 

Lists are ordered sequences that can hold a variety of object types. They used [] and commas to seprate objects in the list.
Lists support indexing and slicing. Lists can be nested and also have a variety of useful methods that can be called off of them.
